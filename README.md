## Higher Diploma in Data Analytics
### Karolina Szafran-Belzowska, G00376368


A conversion course for graduates of level 8 programmes in disciplines other than computing, the aim of this programme is to provide students with a broad knowledge of computing, 
with a specialisation in data analytics. 
This will enable students to apply data analysis techniques to the topics in their original degree, while also providing a foundation on which they can develop their skills in 
the more traditional areas of computing. 
The course covers such skills as automating manual spreadsheet-oriented data analysis processes, converting large data sets into actionable information, and creating web-based 
dashboards for visualising data. 
Level 8 graduates from disciplines such as business and finance are particularly suited to this course, as are those from life and physical sciences.
